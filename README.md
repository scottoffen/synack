# Synack

**noun**  
**/snÃ¦k/**

**1.** A lightweight, high-performance TCP listener and HTTP parser designed as a modern replacement for `HttpListener`.  
&emsp;*"When you've outgrown HttpListener but not grown into Kestrel - that's when you use Synack"*

**2.** (informal) A satisfying, bite-sized solution to heavyweight problems in HTTP handling.  
&emsp;*"When all you need is simple, fast, and HTTP - Synack satisfies."*

**Origin:**  
A portmanteau of *SYN* and *ACK*, the opening handshake packets of TCP communication - pronounced like *snack*, because it's just that good.

**Compare:**  
`HttpListener`, `TcpListener`

## Features

| Feature                    | Description                                                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lightweight Core**       | No dependencies on ASP.NET Core or hosting infrastructure                  |
| **TCP Listener**           | Built directly on `TcpListener` for maximum control                        |
| **HTTP/1.1 Parsing**       | Minimal-allocation request parsing with support for common headers         |
| **Async Request Handling** | Async-first design, no thread-per-connection overhead                      |
| **Pluggable Routing**      | Delegates request handling to your own logic, no built-in router           |
| **Prefix Support**         | Drop-in compatibility for `HttpListener`-style prefix filtering            |
| **Custom Response Logic**  | Full control over response headers, status codes, and body output          |
| **WebSocket Ready**        | Architecture supports future upgrade handling for WebSocket connections    |
| **TLS Support (Planned)**  | Modular TLS support without built-in HTTPS middleware (via `SslStream`)    |
| **Cross-Platform**         | Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS with zero platform-specific behavior     |
